## Configuration
You can set the following per instance of the editor:

![Configuration options][configuration]

#### Label for key
This will be shown in the empty field for the `key`. It defaults to `Name` but could for example be `meta-tag`.

#### Label for value
This will be shown in the empty field for the `value`. It defaults to `Value`.

#### Type Dropdown
Empty by default (no dropdown will be shown). If you add a list of comma separated values they will be turned into a dropdown and store with the data.

## Data structure
The data will be stored as an array with an object per item.

```Javascript
Array({
  key: "someKey",
  value: "yourValue",
  type: "Option"
}, {â€¦})
```
